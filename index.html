				<p>I was born in Wisconsin and moved to Tennesse in 2010. Sports I have played include Football, Rugby, Bowling, and Baseball. Although I injured my shoulder while playing Rugby so I can only bowl for the time being. I love working with anything mechanical and trying to solve problems. After Highschool I want to attend Witchia State University and major in computer sciences.
